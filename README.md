# AgeBond - Family Age Relationship Calculator

AgeBond is a React-based web application that helps you explore and calculate family age relationships through time. Ask questions about when family members will be certain ages, compare ages at different life events, and understand the temporal connections between family members.

## Features

### üßÆ **Guided Mode**
Use pre-defined question templates to calculate:
- When someone will be a specific age
- Age comparisons between family members
- Ages at historical events
- Combined age scenarios

### ‚ú® **AI-Powered Natural Language Queries**
Ask any age-related question about your family in plain English:
- **Specific Calculations**: "When will I be the age my mom is now?"
- **Age Comparisons**: "What's the age difference between me and my siblings?"
- **Future Scenarios**: "How old will everyone be next Christmas?"
- **Family Insights**: "Who's the oldest/youngest in my family?"
- **Complex Queries**: "When will my and my sister's combined age equal mom's age?"
- **General Questions**: "How old will my dad be in 10 years?"

The AI intelligently chooses between template-based calculations for precision and open-ended responses for flexibility.

### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ **Family Management**
- Add family members with birth dates, relationships, and gender
- Simplified relationship types (parent, sibling, etc.) with gender context
- Track important life events
- Persistent data storage in browser

### üîó **Relationship-Aware AI**
- The app works from your perspective as the main person
- AI understands family relationships and gender for more natural responses
- Simplified relationship types combined with gender create precise context
- Use pronouns like "I", "me", "my mom", "my brother" in queries
- **Enhanced AI**: Can answer both structured calculations and open-ended age questions
- **Intelligent Routing**: Automatically chooses the best approach for each query type
- Relationship context makes responses more personal and meaningful
